			At an early age, I was introduced to the world of technology and it's impact on society. During my years of growth, I spent many hours with my computer and grasped the general concept of how Microsoft Windows and the internet work. Over time curiosity got the better of me and I began to write small programs to automate simple things.
		</p>
		<p>
			Currently, I am a student at Mohawk College in the Computer Systems Technology - Software Development program. I plan to complete my diploma and further my education by obtaining a degree.

			Pikaptcha is an application I created to generate Pokemon Go accounts by bypassing Google's reCaptcha verication using 2Captcha's API, and then verifying the email addresses. It was a small side project I took on when the Pokemon Go craze came about and I wanted to create my own maps.
		</p>
		<p>
			Pikaptcha was a great stepping stone and I learned many things along the way such as making REST calls using an API, using Selenium to emulate browsers, and using IMAP to read emails.
