					<h2>Old School Runescape Quest Calculator <span>Language: C#</span></h2>
					<p>
						Using a visual GUI, the user can enter their skill levels and completed quests. Alternatively, the user can look themselves up with the highscores. The application then shows what quests the user is eligible to complete based on their current levels, and current completed quests.<span><a href="https://github.com/sriyegna/OSRS-Quest-Calculator" class="more">Check it out!</a></span>

					<h2>Pikaptcha <span>Language: Python</span></h2>
					<p>
						When Pokemon Go was released, the hype was too large to handle. When the in-game tracker broke, many players resorted to using "maps". These maps were achieved by falsifying the Pokemon Go API and utilizing spare Pokemon Go Trainer accounts to "walk" through the streets to see if they notice any pokemon. As you can imagine, this requires a large amount of accounts to scan a large region so many Pokemon Go Account creators were being made. Eventually when they added recaptcha into the registration page, the other scripts could not bypass that. Only one did, and he charged everyone $10 for the script. So I created a python script that emulates the browser (headless or using chrome) to go through the registration, and if they opted to use 2captcha, then Pikaptcha would automatically solve their captchas for them.<span><a href="https://github.com/sriyegna/Pikaptcha" class="more">Check it out!</a></span>

					<h2>Name Based Note-Taker <span>Language: Python</span></h2>
					<p>
						A problem I had was keeping track of certain things I told certain people. I wrote a Python application to solve this problem. You can either add entries or just view entries of notes by entering a persons name. The application stores the data in a list and writes the list to a text (.txt) file to be read later.<span><a href="https://github.com/sriyegna/Noteapp" class="more">Check it out!</a></span>
